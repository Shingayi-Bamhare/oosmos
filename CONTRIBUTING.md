# Contributing to OOSMOS
Here's a quick rundown of how to contribute to this project.

## Our Development Process
We develop on a private branch internally at OOSMOS. With each 
new release, we update this Github project with the changes 
from the internal repository. External pull requests are 
cherry-picked into our repository and then are included in the 
next public release.

## Pull Requests
We welcome your pull requests!

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
1. Add test(s) if necessary -- self-checking, if possible.
1. Provide documentation if you've added an API.
1. Ensure that existing examples still run -- at least those in directories 
`Basic`, `Ortho`, and `Sync` on either Windows or Linux.
1. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License 
Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once.

description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able 
to reproduce the issue.

OOSMOS documentation is currently maintained only on

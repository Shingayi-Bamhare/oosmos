This example has been tested using mbed.com's developer program workspace.

Plug your 'mbed' device into your computer via USB.  A new drive letter will appear.
Let's say it comes up as the G: drive.

Upload all these files to mbed.com's online workspace and select "compile", which
will initiate a download of the resulting 'bin' file. Drag that file to the 
volume of the device, e.g. the G: drive and then press the reset button on the 
device.
